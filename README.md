# 💫 About Me:
- Networks & Cyber sec student, Placement @MetOffice
- GitHub shows my blogs & some of my coding projects.

## Goals

I am currently building depth in **Python, C, and Networking**, with a clear long-term direction.

My capstone focus is on **building tools that detect, explain, and prevent common infrastructure misconfigurations**, alongside understanding the **secure enterprise endpoint lifecycle** end to end.

- **Python** is my primary tool of choice. I am aiming for strong competence in using it for log parsing, dashboards, web scraping, and practical security and networking tools.
- **C** is a deliberate low-level focus, allowing me to analyse vulnerabilities closer to the hardware, understand memory behaviour, and reason about how systems actually work from machine code through to user input.
- **Networking** is being rebuilt from first principles. Although I have prior experience, I am revisiting fundamentals to ensure my understanding is solid from endpoints through to WANs.

The overarching aim is not to collect languages or tools, but to develop the ability to design, reason about, and build security tooling with confidence and technical depth.

- My Learning progress repo is my diary & thoughts over a span of my 2026 learning journey.
- Completed_Projects repo is split down into snippets of my internship projects+ Full & mini project folders, a fairly self explanatory design.
