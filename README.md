# 💫 About Me

I’m a **Networks & Cyber Security student** currently on placement at the **UK Met Office**, working on enterprise hybrid infrastructure

This GitHub is both:
- A **technical diary** of my learning journey
- A collection of **hands-on projects and tooling** I’ve built along the way

I care about understanding systems properly, from the wire and the hardware up to the software and security controls layered on top.

## 🎯 Goals & Direction

I’m currently developing depth in **Python, C, and Networking**, with a clear long-term focus rather than scattered learning.

My capstone direction is to **design and build tools that detect, explain, and help prevent infrastructure misconfigurations**, alongside gaining a strong understanding of the **secure enterprise endpoint lifecycle** from build to decommission.

### Technical Focus

- **Python**  
  My primary language. I use it for log parsing, dashboards, automation, networking tools, and security-focused scripts. The goal is clean, readable, production-minded code, not one-off scripts.

- **C**  
  A deliberate low-level investment. Learning C helps me reason about memory, performance, and vulnerability classes that higher-level languages abstract away. This gives me a stronger foundation for security analysis and systems thinking.

- **Networking**  
  Being rebuilt from first principles. While I have prior academic experience, I’m revisiting fundamentals to ensure my understanding is solid from **endpoints → LAN → WAN**, with hands-on validation rather than memorisation.

The aim isn’t to collect languages or buzzwords, but to build **real technical judgment**: knowing *why* something works, *where* it breaks, and *how* to design around that.
