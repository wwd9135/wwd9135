# Hi I'm Will!
I’m a Networks & Cyber Security student currently on an industrial placement as a Security Infrastructure Engineer at the Met Office.

I currently manage security for an enterprise estate of 4,500+ devices, bridging the gap between infrastructure and security teams. This GitHub is a collection of the tools I’m building to solve the problems I encounter—from automating triage to understanding the low-level mechanics of encryption.

## Currently Building
- WFTAF (Windows Forensic Triage & Analysis Framework): A modular DFIR tool using a PowerShell/Python pipeline to automate live system acquisition and heuristic analysis using an LLM to enhance edge case/ suspicious activity detection.
- Log Parsing & Normalization: Building robust utilities to transform messy Windows XML logs into structured telemetry for incident response.
- Home Lab: Emulating enterprise network topologies to test lateral movement and detection engineering.


## Focus & Direction
My goal is to move past "running tools" and focus on building them. I want to understand exactly how an attack works at the byte level so I can build better defenses.
- Python: My primary tool for automation. I focus on building modular, readable code for log parsing, security dashboards, and forensic tools.
- PowerShell: Essential for enterprise-scale management. I use it for everything from live forensic acquisition to automating patch compliance.
- C & Systems Thinking: I’m learning C to understand memory management and exploit primitives. It’s a deliberate investment to understand why vulnerabilities happen, not just how to patch them.
- Networking: Rebuilding my knowledge from first principles (Endpoints → LAN → WAN). I prefer hands-on validation in a lab over just memorizing theory.

## Impact so far
- Managed security remediation for a 4,500+ device estate.
- Built a patch compliance dashboard that automated reporting for the entire enterprise.
- Audited and secured 600+ high-risk accounts following a collaborative pen-test.
